                <p class="par">Sony UK Technology Centre, otherwise known as Sony Bridgend, is a division of Sony Europe Limited.  They distribute consumer electronics such as cameras, televisions, computers, and other miscellaneous electronic components.  Not only is it a large multinational company but the technology center also houses thirty two related start-up companies.  Sony UK Technology was opened by the Queen in 1992 and now is one of the largest manufacturers of professional cameras and systems worldwide.</p>
                <p class="par">To say that this is a thriving company is selling Sony short.  This company has not only won numerous awards for their environmental consciousness and quality of the work, but also has been recognized as one of Britain’s best factories.  These are just a few of the awards that Sony UK Technology Centre has received among numerous other awards showing the greatness of this company.  A lot of the staff have also received awards and other recognition that shows how dedicated and impactful the staff is alongside the company.  For example, a woman named Jessica Leigh Jones was listed in the Telegraph’s Top 50 Women in Engineering thanks to her work at the Sony facility.  The company and its employees are dedicated to environmental conservation as well as the community they are a part of.</p>
                <p class="par">In order to support its local community the Sony UK Technology Centre pitches in to support sick children.  They held an event competing against RS Components, another company, to raise money for charities that were picked out by the two companies.  The Sony UK Technology Centre is a socially aware business seeking to not only support the local community , but also wants to be environmentally friendly.  While they are great at being environmentally conscious and supporting the community they are also aware of their employees and make every effort to ensure the welfare of their staff.</p>
                <p class="par">A recent success has been the development of the contract electronics solutions.  Major projects include the creation of LED technology, medical device and the recent success of the Raspberry Pi.  Another recent success has been the Customer Service Centre that provides service and repair for the end users and retailers in the UK.  They have a fast repair turnaround time at hight quality standards making this Centre one of the most successful diversifications so far.</p>
