                <p class="par">In 2018, for the centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People’s Act, Parliament Square will reveal a new statue.  This statue will be made in honor of Millicent Fawcett, a British suffragette in the United Kingdom.  Fawcett will be the first woman to have a statue placed in the Parliament Square among “Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela, and nine other historic male figures” (Bacchi).  The installment of this statue is a great way to remember those who fought their whole lives for women’s rights.</p>
                <p class="par">Millicent Fawcett spent most of her adult life advocating for equal rights for women, not just in voting but in education as well.  She lead peaceful campaigns for equal rights which was much better than some of the violent campaigns that followed.  She also founded the National Union of Women’s Suffrage in 1907 which helped in the fight for equal rights as well as rallying people together that had similar dreams.  Her statue will be depicted holding a sign that reads “courage calls to courage everywhere”.  This quote came from a speech that that Fawcett “read after the death of another famous suffragette Emily Davison” when she stepped out onto the racetrack at the Epsom Derby(Mitchell).</p>
                <p class="par">The idea for this statue was started by activist Caroline Criado-Perez but later brought to light by an online petition backed by J.K. Rowling and Emma Watson that got more than 80,000 signatures.  Because of their efforts this statue will be a permanent historical monument in Parliament Square.  The monument will be cast in bronze and contain the names of other supporters of suffrage along the base of the statue.  This will be a reminder of those people who were instrumental in the fight for equality. </p>
                <p class="par">Gillian Wearing, a Turner-prize winning artist, will be designing the statue.  She is the first woman to design a sculpture for the Parliament Square and it seems fitting that a woman be the one to design the first women sculpture as more of a tribute to women’s rights.  The Mayor of London was quoted in the Huffington Post saying “We want this statue to depict the strength and determination of the women who dedicated their lives to the fight for women’s suffrage and to inspire many generations to come - and I know Gillian’s creation will do just that”.</p>
